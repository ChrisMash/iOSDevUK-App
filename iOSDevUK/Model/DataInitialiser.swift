        The Speech Recognition API is part of the Speech framework and was made available to developers by Apple in iOS 10. This API is used by Siri to perform periodic tasks through speech recognition activities and to improve the overall user experience.
        
        Developers can use speech recognition in their application as a dictation tool which requires no typing and saves a lot of time. This offers convenience and easier access to application features through spoken commands and improves the user engagement and application experience. This is useful for people with certain disabilities or conditions to navigate around and use the app conveniently.  Example use cases for this API are live language translation and quick app actions through spoken words such as a keyword search and application navigation.
        
        In this talk, we will give an introduction to the Speech Recognition API, provide a few technical details on how to use it, explore its building blocks, and its considerations for user privacy. We will also see how we can best design an application with the Speech Recognition API for a great user experience while adhering to the standard guidelines.
        
        Attendees of this session will take away the following:
        
        1. Introduction to iOS Speech Recognition API
        2. How to use and integrate this API with any application
        3. How to handle and trigger speech recognition
        4. User interface and privacy considerations
        
        By the end of the session, I will present a demo of an English-Spanish translation app that I have created using the Speech Recognition API.

The general idea of the talk is to give an overview of all the formatters that exist, what they can and can't format and what their output looks like in different languages and locales to demonstrate why they are necessary. After that, attendees should know to think twice before using -[NSString stringWithFormat:] or Swift's string interpolation to generate user-visible strings because they know: There is already a formatter for that. And they also know that formatting logic is actually much more complicated than you naively assume and the result of using a formatter will be much better than trying to reinvent the wheel yourself."

How to make it as much automated as possible?
